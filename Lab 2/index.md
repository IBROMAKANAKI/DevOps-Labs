# Install Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 22.0.4 | Setup Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 22.0.4 in AWS EC2 | Setup Tomcat on Ubuntu

Apache Tomcat, often referred to as Tomcat, is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Expression Language (EL) technologies. It serves as a web server and a servlet container, providing a platform for deploying and executing Java web applications. Tomcat is widely used in the Java development community for hosting Java-based web applications and supporting the execution of Java servlets and JSP pages.

Key Features and Components:

- Servlet Container:
  Tomcat functions as a servlet container, which means it implements the Java Servlet Specification. Servlets are Java classes that handle requests and generate responses for web applications.

-JSP Support:
 Tomcat supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows developers to embed Java code in HTML pages. JSP pages are compiled into servlets and executed by the servlet container.

- Connectors:
  Tomcat includes connectors that enable communication with different web servers, such as Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS. The connectors facilitate integration with existing infrastructure.

- HTTP Server:
  While Tomcat is primarily known as a servlet container, it also includes a built-in HTTP server. This allows Tomcat to serve static content and handle HTTP requests directly.

- Manager Applications:
  Tomcat provides web-based management applications, such as the Tomcat Manager and Host Manager, which allow administrators to deploy, un-deploy, and manage web applications.

Tomcat Usage:

Web Application Deployment:

Tomcat is used to deploy and run Java web applications. Developers package their applications as WAR (Web Application Archive) files and deploy them to Tomcat.

Development and Testing:

Tomcat is commonly used during the development and testing phases of Java web applications. It provides a lightweight environment for testing servlets and JSP pages.


Integration with Other Technologies:

Tomcat is often integrated with other technologies, such as Apache HTTP Server or reverse proxy servers, to enhance performance and scalability.

Embedded Usage:

Tomcat can be embedded in Java applications, allowing developers to run a servlet container within their application.

## Pre-requisites:
Make sure you create brand new **EC2 instance** first for setting up Tomcat.
Also open **port 8080** in security firewall rules for EC2 instance in AWS

## Please follow below steps to install Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 22.0.4.

**Change Host Name to Tomcat**
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Tomcat
```
**Update to Latest packages**
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**Install Tomcat9**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tomcat9 tomcat9-docs tomcat9-admin -y
```
![Tomcat Install](Assets/Images/Tomcat install.jpg)

Setup an user in tomcat 
Open the tomcat-users.xml file by executing below command
sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

**Perform below command for setting up tomcat admin app**
```bash
sudo cp -r /usr/share/tomcat9-admin/* /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ -v
```
**Setup an user in tomcat**
- Open the tomcat-users.xml file by executing below command
```bash
sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml
```

**You need to edit the file**
- vi or sudo vi to open a file editor and then press i or insert
- make the changes (avoid using mouse)
- press escape button
- :wq! (saving and exiting the file after changes)

Add tomcat user and assign to manager-script role.
Scroll down all the way to the end of the file,
Add the below lines in second last line above (above </tomcat-users>)

```bash
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="password" roles="manager-script"/>
```
<style>
.image-row {
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.image-row img {
  width: 200px;
  height: auto;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.image-row img:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
</style>

<div class="image-row">
  <img src="Assets/Images/Insert 1.jpg" alt="Insert tomcat login">
  <img src="Assets/Images/insect 2.jpg" alt="Insert tomcat">
</div>

**Now restart tomcat to take the changes in effect**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tomcat9
```
**Verify if tomcat9 is working fine**

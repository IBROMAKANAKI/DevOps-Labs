# Lab Exercise # 2 - CICD setup - Install Jenkins in One instance and Tomcat on second EC2 instance in AWS Cloud

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines
 
**follow the steps to install Java, Jenkins, Maven on Ubuntu 22.0.4 instance. Jenkins, Maven are Java based applications, so we need to install Java first.**

# Steps

## 1. üîó Connect to the Jenkins Instance from a Local Machine After Creating an EC2 Instance on AWS

- Open the AWS Console
   i) Navigate to **https://console.aws.amazon.com**.

   ii) Sign in to your AWS account.

- Locate Your **Jenkins EC2 Instance**

    i) From the AWS Console, go to the EC2 Dashboard.

    II) Click on Instances in the left-hand menu.

    iii) Find and select your Jenkins EC2 instance from the list.

- Click "Connect"

    i) With your Jenkins instance selected, click the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button at the top of the page.

- Choose "SSH Client" Option

    i) Under the "Connect to instance" page, select the SSH Client tab.

    ii) You will see an example SSH command provided by AWS (e.g., ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-XX-XX-XX-XX.compute-1.amazonaws.com).

- Prepare to Connect from Your Local Machine

   i) Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

  ii) Change directory to where your .pem key file is downloaded.

</div>

<script>
  function showLightbox(src) {
    document.getElementById('zoomedImg').src = src;
    document.getElementById('lightbox').style.display = 'flex';
  }
</script>

## 2. üõ†Ô∏è Update the System

Before installing any packages, update the system‚Äôs package list to get the latest versions:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## 3. ‚òï Install Java 17

To install Java 17 on your Ubuntu system, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
```
- Verify Java Version
  
```bash
java -version
```
![Java version check](Assets/Images/Java version.jpg)

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Maven Installation
Maven is a popular build tool used for building Java applications. Maven is a popular build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps manage project dependencies, builds, and documentation from a central piece of information.

To install Maven on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt install maven -y
you can type mvn --version
```

## 5. üß∞ Jenkins Setup
Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used in the field of DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). It enables developers to automate parts of the software development process, 

- Building the code

- Testing it automatically

- Deploying to staging or production environments

### üöÄ Key Features of Jenkins:
- Open Source: Free to use with strong community support.

- Extensible: Offers thousands of plugins to integrate with virtually any tool in the CI/CD toolchain (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven).

- Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

- Scalable: Can be configured for both small projects and enterprise-scale pipelines.

- Pipeline-as-Code: Supports Jenkinsfile (a text file that defines your CI/CD pipeline).

**i. Add Repository key to the system**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
```

**ii. Append debian package repo address to the system**
```bash
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```
![Add Repository and Append debian](Assets/Images/curl.jpg)

**iii. üîÑ Update Ubuntu Package List**
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Install Jenkins
```bash
sudo apt install jenkins -y
```
![install jenkins](Assets/Images/install jenkins.jpg)

### ‚úÖ Verify if Jenkins Server is Running

After installation, confirm that the Jenkins service is active by checking its status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

The above screenshot should confirm that Jenkins is successfully installed.

### üåê Access Jenkins via Web Browser

- Log into your AWS Console.
- Navigate to EC2 > Instances.
- Select the running instance where Jenkins is installed.
- Under the "Connect" tab, copy the Public DNS (IPv4) or Public IP.
- Open a web browser and enter the following URL (replace with your DNS or IP):

**üìù Note: Make sure port 8080 is open in the Security Group attached to your instance and add 8080 to the end of the URL.**

```text
http://<EC2_public_dns_name>:8080
```

  .image-box {
    text-align: center;
    position: relative;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  }

  .image-box img {
    width: 400px;
    cursor: zoom-in;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);

<div class="image-row">
  <div class="image-box">
    <img src="Assets/Images/URL.jpg" alt="URL" />
    <p>üîó URL without Port</p>
  </div>

  <div class="arrow">‚û°Ô∏è</div>

  <div class="image-box">
    <img src="Assets/Images/URL 80.jpg" alt="URL with 8080" />
    <p>üåê URL with Port 8080</p>
  </div>
</div>

### üîì Unlock Jenkins
Once you access Jenkins in your browser (via http://<EC2_public_dns_name>:8080), you will see a screen asking for an Administrator password.

**üíª To retrieve it, run the following command in your Ubuntu terminal (Git Bash or EC2 console)***

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```                       
![Key](Assets/Images/Unlock.jpg)

**Copy the password and paste in the browser.**

![install plug-in](Assets/Images/j1.jpg)

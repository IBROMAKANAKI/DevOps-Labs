# DevOps Lab 1 : Provision Ubuntu 22.0.4 EC2 Instance | How to create EC2 instance in AWS console | Launch Ubuntu 22.0.4 instance in AWS

## Introduction4

Welcome to my first lab exercise! In this project, I'm creating a basic infrastructure on AWS by provisioning two EC2 instances. These virtual machines will be used to install and configure Jenkins and Apache Tomcat.

This setup is the foundation for future DevOps practices, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## What is EC2 instance? 

It is virtual server provided by AWS. I will be using this EC2 to setup both Jenkins and Tomcat. Please follow the below steps to create an EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:

- You have an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Steps

To launch an EC2 instance, log in to the AWS Management Console and click on **“Launch Instance”** under the EC2 dashboard.
